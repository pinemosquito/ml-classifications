# Fundamental under the hood: Support Vector Machine
## What it is 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a state-of-the-art classification method introduced in 1992 by Boser, Guyon and Vapnik.
SVM classification algorithm implement kernel method. Kernel method has several inherent advantages including ability to generate non-linear decision boundaries and ability to classify data that doesnâ€™t have fixed dimensions.
When training SVM, user needs to make several decisions.  What kernel to use.  How to optimize parameters for the SVM and the kernel.
